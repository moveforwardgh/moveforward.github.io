                    <p>Today we are experiencing the strong impact of a new pandemic related to COVID-19, that is hitting the entire planet, and which doesn't discriminate between borders, ethnic groups, or ideologies.</p>

                    <p>That is not a mere product of the mutation of a specific virus in a random time or place, but a consequence of multiple predictable processes that unfortunately we have not been able to stop or counteract effectively, such as avoiding zoonotic -animals infecting humans- impacts product of human expansion over the environment, the inability to create efficient global systems of health and epidemiological response, or even having a responsible population culture in the face of eventual health adversity; by that, among other things, we are now facing great multiple negative consequences as a result of an insufficient and inefficient global social organization.</p>

                    <p>The reality is that infectious diseases are old problems that today have a planetary scope, and like many other serious old global problems that we face today, we haven't been able to solve them. Faced with these, we are not being efficient at all in solving them, and consequently, they are causing us very negative consequences in the present and possibly even more in the near future.</p>
                    
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/population.png" alt="">

                    <p>This pandemic will probably be a critical juncture in the history of Homo sapiens, where our future will depend on how the situation develops, and especially on the actions we take as a civilization. All of this will lead to different paths that will mark the future, and in which, one or another vision of society will prevail. By that, on one hand, there is an opportunity to make the necessary changes to move towards a better future, or on the other hand, going backward to a chaotic time in which suffering and problems will prevail or even become more negative.</p>

                    <b>Opportunity to move forward</b>

                    <p>Our present situation requires us to make urgent changes and transformations of different nature; related to aspects of culture, society, organizational models, and especially ways of thinking, that in combination would change the dynamics of the structures and responses to these global problems, and that will allow us not only to respond to the current and future pandemics but also to the future global problems of different nature that we face now and will face later on.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/ahead.png" alt="">

                    <p>Here, consequently, we explore three transformational needs that are aming at the short and medium timeframe: a) greater globalization; b) promotion of scientific thought; and c) strengthen collective capacities.</p>
                    
                    <b>1. Greater globalization</b>

                    <p>Once again, global problems arise, which cannot be solved without a global framework of thinking and action; and that's why local, national or regional frameworks are not sufficient as we see today, in which our institutions and ways of action are not globally orientated, and consequently we are being incapable of tackling the situation effectively.</p>

                    <p>In a pandemic and post-pandemic scenario, it is necessary for us to begin to strengthen existing global and local oriented movements, organizations and institutions, and also create new needed ones. By this, there is a need to improve operational capacities, use of resources or technical-scientific skills; but especially also the ability to respond in a coordinated manner between all of them that are alike.</p>
                    
                    <p>This would imply strengthening global organizations of different nature, such as supranational public-state organizations, civil society organizations or institutions of different kinds; whose articulation will require a broad debate on institutional arrangements, organizational models, ways of financing and different attributions of powers.</p>

                    <b>2. Promotion of scientific thinking</b>

                    <p>This pandemic event makes it more than ever clear there is a need to appeal to science and think scientifically in a general way, both to solve the actual problem, as well as to prevent others of the same kind from happening in the future. By contrast, this situation has also exposed magical, religious and traditional thinking as useless ways of thinking and solving problems, and in which we need to abandon faster.</p>

                    <p>Progress has already been made in this regard, and that's why almost all the medical centers on the planet have begun to use medicine based on scientific frameworks, and have partially left aside traditional and archaic forms of medicine -even in very traditional oriented countries-; but this is unfortunately not enough, we are still very far from a minimum necessary global standard of scientific thinking, and gaining a healthy balance between science and other sectors could prevent very adverse consequences in the short term.</p>
                   
                   <p>This is an opportunity to accelerate, catalyze and deepen a global scientific culture, as well as the institutions and organizations necessary to shape it, which will require the promotion of the ideas and frameworks in multiple sectors and areas of living, especially in those places and regions that still persist in archaic forms of thought.</p>
                   
                   <b>3. Greater sustainability</b>

                    <p>It is no coincidence that this pandemic arose from the same origin that many other major problems we face and are emerging, such as climate change or the mass extinction of species; that are a product of excessive pressure by Homo sapiens on the ecosystem in general; and by that, this health-related situation was something predictable and foreseeable, that many experts have warned about, and also eventually will happen again if we cannot address the root causes that are causing it.</p>

                    <p>So, if we want to solve this current problem, and avoid new ones in the future, we have to reconsider how we live, and change our way of life based on destruction and pollution, towards a sustainable and regenerative way of life that is friendly to the ecosystem, that will imply new sustainable behaviors, the relation with the consumption of animals, the increasing massive urban pressure on natural spaces, and many other necessary things.</p>
                    
                    <b>4. Strengthen collective capacities</b>

                    <p>Nowadays, many widespread regions cannot access quality public services, such as health, education, culture, and housing, as well as many other needs that make subsequent generations continue in a situation of misery, ignorance, and inhuman life.</p>

                    <p>Today we have the necessary resources, knowledge and technology capable  of giving all the inhabitants of this planet the ability to live full lives and contribute to the development of civilization, preserving the environment and contributing to historical progress.</p>

                    <p>This will require strengthening and creating global collective-oriented organizations and institutions of different nature, that will be necessary to direct actions and processes to those regions that most need it, especially the most vulnerable and lagging behind ones. All of this implies a global transfer of resources, capacities and knowledge, as well as mutual responsibilities and the creation of a common global ethical culture; that together can give rise to synergistic global processes that enhance collective capacities to thrive together.</p>
                
                    <b>The other course...</b>

                    <p>Taking sensible actions now will prevent we fall into generalized tribal thinking, nationalism and isolationist forms of social organizations; that will eventually will not be able to respond to global problems, and consequently cause widespread multiple negative consequences for the great part of the population, such as the impact of new pandemics, wars, economic crises, widespread misery, and many other things that they will cause a lot of suffering, setbacks and also possibly existential risks.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/earth-fire.png" alt="">

                    <p>Unfortunately, these trends have been growing in recent years, but still, nothing is lost, and this pandemic situation is an opportunity to realize where we have to go and act to reverse the trend.</p>
