                    <i>March 15, 2021</i>

                    <p>In the past, a series of ideas and ideologies have emerged that promoted various changes towards socio-organizational alternatives based on the ideas of equity, solidarity and co-decision making in the administration of goods and services, that were the ideas of the labor movements -or workers movement-, which originated in the nineteenth century; among these we can identify Marxism-Leninism, anarchism and social democracy, as well as the various other kinds of reformisms.</p> 

                    <p>Although they were positive in principle, and also have achieved many good things towards improving society, now they can no longer represent the current reality, and much less be the foundations of the future changes that we need, due to multiple assumptions and principles that they have that are no longer relevant, like certain old frameworks that have to be overcome, ones that we will explain consequently.</p>

                    <b>Industrialist thinking</b>

                    <p>Labor movements generally belong to an historical time that no longer exists, which was the industrial age, and through which they developed their referential frameworks that respond to specific problems of that time.</p>
                    
                    <p>When this era ceased to exist, mainly due to the growing advance of automation and informational technologies, the classic industrial worker had to move mainly towards the service sector, and by that their respective identities and organizations of solidarity and political pressure either vanished or strongly declined.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/industrialismo.png" alt="">

                    <p>As a consequence of industrial thought and certain frameworks associated with it, these various currents developed an erroneous theory of emancipation that was based on a supposed universal historical subject, known as the “working class” or proletariat. This corresponds to those subjects who do not have a property in the means of production, and as a consequence of the exploitation and contradictions of this supposed position, will emerge something that is called the class struggle that will eventually overwrought the current system towards a new post-capitalist one.</p>
                    
                    <p>This concept and way of looking at macro-socio political changes is a theoretical flaw, which was the product of the industrialist bias; the fact is that this supposed universal identity no longer exists -or even never existed-, because it was the simple product of a historical stage that has now been mutated or even largely vanished at this stage. This subject and its consequent perspectives also vanished, giving a rise on a lot of different historical subjects and possible agents of change.</p>

                    <p>At present, new problems face us, such as ecological challenges related to climate change and pollution, job precarity, the privatization of the commons -such as knowledge-, unhappiness, drug addiction, and many other problems that industrial thinking does not even identify. In addition, we face not only those issues from today but also those that will emerge in the near future, such as technological unemployment, the dilemmas of bioengineering, the dangers of artificial intelligence and many other incipient problems that we are already beginning to see.</p>

                    <p>Faced with those problems, the industrial thinking related to those labor-workers movements have very little or even nothing to say, because it is not capable of understanding them and even less of giving effective solutions, simply because those movements and ideas arose to respond to problems of another era.</p>

                    <p>A new emancipatory project will have to get out of this labourist framework and enter a post-industrialist one, that corresponds with the post-industrial era, which presents many opportunities, but also many new big problems.</p>

                    <p>Today it is necessary for us to abandon this theoretical concept of the proletariat, to discover and build new subjects of emancipation and social advancement, which adjust to the parameters of our present and the consequent future era that awaits us.</p>
                    
                    <b>Anthropocentrism</b>

                    <p>Labourist movements were also child of classical modernity, and by that, they were characteristic of strong anthropocentrism, where they saw humanity and humans as the centrality of the world, and generally left aside of moral and political consideration other sentient beings such as animals or even the environment, which had been noted as instrumental elements at the mercy of the functionality for the production and reproduction of the human.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/antropocentrismo.png" alt="">

                    <p>A new perspective should be based on the consideration of a framework that goes beyond anthropocentrism and humanism in general, and that consider politically relevant to other sentient beings and also the environment in which we all live, as well as a possible future where the Homo sapiens might become subordinate due to the appearance of new life forms based on biotechnology and artificial intelligence, which in turn will bring many dilemmas and ethical-moral problems that we will have to face; that is, in other words, we need to move from anthropocentrism to posthumanism, ecocentrism and sensocentrism.</p>
                    
                    <b>Internationalism</b>

                   <p>Labour movements promote an internationalist way of thinking -even more nationalist than internationalist-; although internationalism is clearly superior to nationalism, this framework is not capable of facing the new global problems that emerged and will continue to emerge in our time. Those internationalist visions, although in a certain way they focus on partially overcoming the nation-state, are still fit and framed into a nation state-centred perspective, which only tries to create soft bonds of solidarity between national-based social movements and states.</p> 

                   <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/internacionalismo.png" alt="">

                    <p>But this is not enough, today we face inherently global problems, which present a risk for all the inhabitants of this planet, such as climate change, pandemics, massive pollution, development of high weapons technology, the emergence of intelligence artificial, technological unemployment, inequality and many other problems that do not see borders between countries and also can’t be solved by the dynamics of national action.</p>
    
                    <p>To solve this, it is necessary to respond globally through new planetary organizational systems and social movement that can respond to these new problems in a supra-national way; and in turn consequently, for this, it is necessary to develop a common planetary identity and a global way of decision making and organizational building in general. This is a big leap, and it is clear in advance that those initiatives must be gradual and consensual since they cannot be achieved from one year to the next.</p>

                    <b>Post-conflict</b>

                    <p>Another theoretical failure of the labourist framework with bad repercussions at the socio-organizational level is the belief that there is one unequivocal and historical cause of human conflicts, that is related to the type of ownership of the means of production, the inequality of resources between groups or many other similar conceptualizations, and by that, they suppose that by getting rid of these configurations, the social conflict will end, thus reaching a post-conflict situation.</p>

                    <p>This vision associated with labourism, along with many others of different nature that are not worth mentioning here, are related to utopian and reductionist views of social conflict and violence in general; the truth is that social conflict will continue to exist every time in a more or less degree because we must understand that societies -especially big and complex ones- are inherently conflictive, then is to be expected that even a more equitable and horizontal society many zero-sum games, conflicts between groups and problems of various kinds will remain to exist, and which we must try to understand and solve at least partially.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/posconflicto.png" alt="">

                    <p>Given this, in the face of a possible new society, it is necessary to create new organizational and conflict resolution systems orientated to mitigate conflicts and problems in general as much as possible with various strategies and modes of organization, definitively abandoning the belief that there is only one source of conflict or that the sources conflict can are easily resolved.</p>

                    <b>Reactionray thinking</b>

                    <p>Those projects associated with the labor movement, which sometimes presented an alternative social system or structures, were more reactionary than pro-actionary, that is, rather than having a clear vision of what to do when the system changes, they were limited to criticizing the injustices of the prevailing system and promoting a change towards something that they did not have at all clear, which some times were insufficient or inefficient, and at other times it was highly negative in social and environmental terms.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/reaccionarismo.png" alt="">

                    <p>Therefore, since they don’t have good understanding how social systems work, especially because the labourist conception of the world has many theoretical flaws, they were not able to formulate effective alternative projects to overcome current systems of social organization, and as a consequence, on the circumstantial occasions that they had the opportunity to change something, they were not able to solve them effectively the situation or the issues that they pretended to solve.</p>

                    <p>This forces us to propose new alternative post-labourist frameworks of understanding the social world, in combination with new socio-organizational systems and social movements that not fall in a simple criticism of the current problems and injustices, that is, it is necessary to be pro-actionary, rather than just reactionary.</p>

                    <b>The post-labourist way</b>

                    <p>Present classical-labourist frameworks are not capable of understanding how society works, and consequently, they are not capable of proposing effective solutions to the problems we face today, since their frames of reference belong to another era that no longer exists.</p>

                    <p>And partly because of this, today they have lost almost all the massive social presence that they once presented, going to occupy marginal positions in the social imaginary, like many other current pre-modern ideologies -like theocentric ones- that did not know how to adapt to the emerging changes of history.</p>

                    <p>Given this, we have to reformulate these aspects together and amalgamate them into a new post-labourist paradigm of progress that will overcome the limitations and errors of labourism.</p>
