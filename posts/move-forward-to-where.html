                    <b>Where do we come from? </b>

                    <p>Homo Sapiens from its origins was just another primate in the evolutionary chain belonging to this small blue planet located in the Milky Way; in those times, in order to survive we dedicated ourselves to collecting fruits, being scavengers and fleeing from predators. We were a very vulnerable species, which at first was not different from any other subordinate species in the food chain at the mercy of nature.</p>                    
                   
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/origins.png" alt="">

                    <p>But as we all know, evolution endowed us with fundamental changes in our anatomy; especially with a highly developed brain, that allowed us to have the ability to understand, manipulate the environment and communicate flexibly on a large scale. These capabilities quickly took us to the top of the pyramid of animals; and in the way we learned to manipulate fire to cook, to create spears to hunt, to build homes to take refuge, and create complicated languages ​​to communicate. All of this gave us a strong advantage in relation to other animals, we could get and digest food easily and defend ourselves from other animals attackers without a major problem; which left us free time for other activities, which eventually allowed for specialization and the accumulation of intergenerational knowledge and resources.</p>

                    <p>Eventually this small population turned into billions of people, primitive tools turned into industrial robots, huts into skyscrapers, tribes into nations, herbs into antibiotics, and fruit pickers into operators of complex production models.</p>

                    <p>At the same time, local conflicts became into international wars, spears in atomic bombs, horses in war tanks, warriors in soldiers, arrows in drones, and a few fruitless trees in vast drylands  irretrievable due to soil degradation. In the middle of that also emerged many economic doctrines, philosophies, religions, social classes, empires, wars, pacification, famines, epidemics, scientific discoveries, population expansions, animal extinctions, and various technological developments that constitute the planetary civilization that we are now.</p>
                    
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/sat.png" alt="">
                    If history teaches us anything, it is that our life on this small planet is not easy; what can be experienced as progress, can eventually end up being a problem; what seems stable can quickly turn into chaos, and what is adversity can turn into an opportunity.</p>

                    <b>Where are we now?</b>

                    <p>Despite multiple adversities, lots of suffering, and many times being on the brink of total destruction, we are still here. And by now, we have also developed societies of millions of people throughout the entire planet, we have made many tecno-scientific advances, and developed extremely complex social imaginaries. All of this thanks to intergenerational knowledge and resources accumulation, and a lot of luck; giving rise to things that those original Homo sapiens were not capable of even imagining.</p>

                    <p>We have not only created advancements and good things, but also we created unimaginable challenges, unnecessary problems, and even existential threats; that in many cases they still remain with us, and if we don't address many wrong issues with our social existence many other serious ones that we still don't know completely are yet to appear.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/pobreza-ninos.png" alt="">

                    <p>Among the persistent problems that still are with us, ones which the current prevailing systems do not seem to be able to satisfactorily solve; we can point to issues like the persistent billions of people still with unsatisfied basic needs, the enormous levels of economic and social inequality, war and violent conflicts, slavery and human trafficking, persistent epidemics, and many other problems that are very long dated.</p>

                    <p>About the rapidly worsening new problems, we find issues such as: widespread pollution and climate change, job insecurity and precarity, rising structural unemployment, the increase in wars and terrorism, nuclear re-weaponization, massive-scale inter-continental migrations of people, the depredation of resources and environmental degradation, the mass extinction of species, the growth of psychological diseases; among many other issues alike charactersitc of our present time.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/destruccion-habitat.png" alt="">

                    <p>Not only is our current time it's quite challenging, in the near future, we may face important difficult scenarios such as the effects of structural technological unemployment, the uncertain impact of biotechnology on humans, the application of artificial intelligence in weapons, pathogens antibiotic resistance, possible new pandemics, and many other possible emerging problems that we are not able to envision yet.</p>

                    <p>If there is something clear between the persistent problems and challenges, and also about those that are getting worse and the emerging ones that are still to come, it is that with the current frameworks-worldviews and established structures we are not capable of solving them. Given this, it is necessary for us to achieve many changes of different nature to face them, specially by addressing their root causes; and also be prepared in a proper way to face those that will appear.</p>                    
                    
                    <p>Fortunately, as history shows, when we face adverse times and situations, opportunities also arise; in that sense, today we can find incredible opportunities and facilitations to create and implement new ideas, organizational models, and responses that allow us to face these problems. Things that we have now especially regarding the development of social and applied sciences, technological advancements, improved socio-organizational capacities, centuries of ethical progress, and many other things that came thanks to intergenerational learning and accumulation of knowledge and resources.</p>

                    <b>Where do we go?</b>

                    <p>To adapt and give a comprehensive response to various of those fundamental issues that we need to afront, to enable a prosperous future, we should reconfigure how we think and how we organize ourselves socially. That implies, prompting transformation processes through new bases of ideas and concrete actions that adapt to these challenges and envision clearly new opportunities for the future.</p>

                    <p>For this, we should leave behind many old ideas, institutions and organizational models that have been a product of the past; that either were oriented to address old issues, or that were simply inertia of past historical processes; which today stagnate us in a vulnerable situation.</p>
                    
                    <p>And in that sense, we should embrace a transition process towards new ways of thinking, acting and organizing ourselves in an emergent historical future; in which the bases of it are in our present time, and will, as it should, be a co-created heterogeneous emergent process.</p>

                    <p>Although it is not possible to predict how the future should be, here we propose some general transitional alignments and ideas that are crucial in the way forward.</p>

                    <i>From traditional thinking to trans-personal reflexive-thinking</i>

                    <p>Ways of thinking are not innocuous, they allow us to configure our frameworks and interpretive models of what happens in reality; that is, about how to understand and have knowledge about what happens around us.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/ciencia.png" alt="">

                    <p>Today, we remain largely stuck in very old ways of thinking¿; such as traditional pre-modern frameworks of thought -like religious worldviews-, or also biased intra-group thinking -like nationalism or sectarian political ideologies-, which are clearly not good models to interpret the current reality. Today, old ways of thinking have clearly become a hindrance to social progress and wellbeing; there are thousands of examples of these, such as the religious opposition to issues such as stem cell research, the opposition of pseudo-environmentalists to issues such as bioengineering of food, new age groups that are against science-based medicine, or moral relativist views that justify the cruelty of certain practices such as genital mutilation or racial discrimination.</p>

                    <p>Our problems, challenges, and opportunities require a new way of thinking; one that allows us to understand in the best way how reality works, how to establish cause-effect relations, understand -at least partially -the behavior of complex systems, and our manifestations in these structures that we call society.</p>
                    
                    <p>To achieve these, we should frame knowledge differently, deviating from the forms of the past, and embracing a joint-reflexive and self-correcting method of creating knowledge and understanding the world, in which tradition-based or ego-centered thinking has little role.</p>
                   
                    <p>One of the most reliant joint-reflexive methods of thinking that we have today, it is the scientific method; that in some way it has turned out to be one of the most effective ways of understanding the world. In the sense, the scientific method is based -or it should be based- in a global-collaborative-open manner it allows us to predict complex phenomena, and apply it to create efficient technological artifacts; something that very few or none of the previous ways of thinking have been effective in doing that.</p>

                    <p>By that, we need to frame the transition towards a more reflexive, open, common and scientific minded manner of thinking; abandoning tradition-based worldviews, subjective thinking, or tribe-based  ways of understanding about ourselves and the world that surround us.</p>

                    <i>From local to glocal</i>

                    <p>Since the beginning of time, societies became more complex due to population growth, intergenerational accumulation of knowledge, and technological development; which forced the creation of new organizational levels to solve emerging problems. From there, we went from groups of few people to tribes, later to regional communities, and recently to nation-states, which is where we mostly find ourselves today respectively.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/global.png" alt="">

                    <p>Today we face the same situation as our ancestors, in which the current forms of organization related to the nation-state are not capable of giving an effective response to the global problems that we face today. Issues which do not respect borders; such as planetary pollution, climate change, international wars, nuclear annihilation possibilities, great intercontinental migrations, control of artificial intelligence, the challenges of the application of biotechnology, or the impact of global economic crisis, among many others. Faced with these problems, nationalists do not have an answer for them, that is why in most cases they simply deny their existence or belittle them.</p>

                    <p>For this, we need to gradually build and strengthen supranational organizations aimed to comprehensively contemplate society and put focus on these most urgent global issues. By this, moving towards a holistic and distributed global form of organization in the long term, which may enable it to definitively surpass the nation-states. This implies creating a common planetary culture, creating mechanisms for the equitable distribution of resources between regions, and concentrating decisions in some sort of multi-level distributed-participatory decision-making system that includes all people and regions of the planet.</p>

                    <p>Also, globalization dynamics cannot go in detriment to the local sphere, as some contemporary processes have been negatively doing, based in some sort of world-utopia thinking. The future forms of social organization must be plural, heterogeneous, integrated, and coordinated. Given this, we must embrace the concept of glocalism, that combines the local with the global, in a synergistic and integrative framework; in which the local particularities are incorporated in the global structures in a complementary manner; and not nulling them like some globalists ideas and processes propose.</p>

                    <i>From anthropocentrism to post-humanism</i>

                    <p>Anthropocentrism and humanists ideas in general have been very effective in displacing other traditional conceptions of how to understand the world, on giving answers to some important ethical questions, and also in giving us models related to how to organize social-organizational systems; this is why it has displaced all previous ways of understanding the world -like theocentric views-, clearly becoming the best conception for the prosperity of society in the recent past.</p>

                    <p>But this seems to be changing, multiple advances in scientific knowledge, ethical theory and in technological developments not only put in check several of the anthropocentric assumptions -such as human exceptionalism, free will or the concept of Homo sapiens “rationality”; but at the same time, we are witnessing the emergence of new problems in which the anthropocentric lenses do not have answers; issues like such as the massive manipulation of people with informational technologies, genetic modification of humans, creation of agents and life based on artificial intelligence, the responsibility of autonomous weapons in wars, and many other problems that are becoming crucial in our present and the near future.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/humano-maquina.png" alt="">

                    <p>It's that way, that we need new answers belonging to new ways of thinking; ones that incorporate the best of humanism, but that overcome challenges through new interpretative frameworks that can allow us to respond to all these emerging challenges. It is still difficult to know how to approach these new problems, but something that we surely have to do is adopt new post-anthropocentric visions related to post-humanism, system-centered thinking, and new less-biased decision-making models that may enable to achieve a better social organization related to solve the current and future challenges.</p>

                    <p>All of this will require long debates within a long time frame of analysis,  but now the time has come to start taking on such responsibilities immediately to create new kinds of post-anthropocentric lenses so that all these problems do not surprise us when they arrive, if they are not already here.</p>

                    <i>From imbalance to regeneration</i>

                    <p>Since the appearance of Homo sapiens, the environment has been negatively impacted by its presence, even since the first tribes of hunter-gatherers expanded and grew. Later, when large-scale societies emerged, this problem became much worse; especially since the time of the industrial era and the massive demographic growth after that; which had generated extremely negative effects at the global scale, giving birth to this era called the anthropocene, in which we are now.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/sustentabilidad.png" alt="">

                    <p>To address the ecosystemic-environmental catastrophe ahead, we need to incorporate principles of sustainability, resilience, and regenerative thinking into a new train of thought; as well in our organizations and the urgent responses to the problems we face, like issues such as climate change or land desertification, the massive extinction of species, deforestation and many other symptoms of current imbalance that we are responsible for.</p>

                    <p>All this may require many things that we need to do, like changing our energy system towards green energy, changing our culture of consumption, promoting the idea of ​​cyclical production and creating systems for the recovery and caring of the environment and the beings that cohabit with us in it.</p>

                    <i>From industrialism to post-industrialism</i>

                    <p>Today we are experiencing a very important transition regarding how we relate to each other, how we produce goods and how we organize society in general; a change similar to the one we experienced in the transition from the agriculture era to the industrial one respectively.</p>

                    <p>This transition implies an increasing growth of organizational complexity, as also the importance and prevalence of new production models and ways to live related with the emergent post-industrial era; that is characteristic of a predominance of knowledge on the production of goods, a shift from the physical space towards digitization, and many other things that may alter radically the current organizational structures.</p>

                    <p>At the macro-organizational level, given the growing organizational complexity, we must gradually abandon old decision-making structures, especially those placed on big scope macro-organizations. This implies starting to leave behind ways to make decisions via pure electoral-representative-party models, or vertical socially unaccountable models that are characteristic of big private-corporations. Now we need to develop decision-making systems and processes assisted and coordinated by cybernetics in combination with open-horizontal participation; which will require the impulse of large-scale technical and scientific organizations, transdisciplinary sectorial decisions and decentralized people participation at different organizational scales.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/automatizacion.png" alt="">

                    <p>On the productive level, we should leave behind the idea that large-scale homogeneous industrial models are going to provide the means of life to survive and achieve well-being; such as industrial employment or standardized education, which is no longer possible due to advances in complex knowledge systems and automated production. The activities of the post-industrial era are based on highly complex knowledge and the coordination of many people, which will require new heterogeneous ways of learning, a disengagement of means of living with jobs, equitable access to goods and services, and many other things alike that can give us abundance for all.</p>

                    <p>That is, in this post-industrial era, we need to repair our society and seek solutions to the great problems that the industrial era has left us; such as massive pollution, climate change, poverty, enormous inequality, dependence on fossil fuel, inefficient decision-making systems, and many other problems and challenges.</p>

                    <b>How do we get there?</b>

                    <p>All these transitions will take time, and they will not have a homogeneous impact on the entire planet; so we need to find ways to make this transition as stable, efficient, distributed and organized as possible.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the transition from the local to the glocal scale: it will be necessary to gradually create and promote inter and supranational organizations and institutions, oriented to solve urgent problems such as climate change, pollution, socioeconomic inequalities and regional asymmetries, different types of discriminations, global economic instability, migratory crises, and the growing trend towards war-conflicts and terrorist threats, among many other issues. This will require especially that the most powerful countries allocate resources in the most disadvantaged regions, actions that some actors will play a big role, like political parties, social movements, state institutions, academia and think tanks.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the transition from imbalance to regeneration: there is the need to start promoting a change in culture at a personal and group level that includes a sustainable way of living and the protection of the environment. Also, in complement to the previous, we need urgent changes in our economic systems, towards cyclical and circular models of production and consumption; all of these should be accompanied by public policy initiatives and actions in general related to recover the environmental damage that we have done so far, and also build in prevention of future negative impacts. This will require allocating many resources to the dissemination of information from and to civil society and public institutions, legislation of rules around recycling, sustainability standards, the promotion of new mixed economy models, foment research and development around the creation of new sustainable technologies such as renewable energy or non-pollutant transport, among other many necessary things.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the transition from anthropocentrism to post-humanism: there is a need to start promoting post-anthropocentric views in thought-generating participative circles and institutions, and also find ways to communicate these types of ideas to the general population. All of this implies trying to think and decide around issues such as new systemic theories of reality, genetic modification in living organisms, incorporation of technology into our anatomy, the development of artificial intelligence related to different areas, and many other related different post-humanist topics.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the transition from the industrial to the post-industrial era: there is a need to focus forces around changing the macro-decision system, this requires joint action between political parties and social movements on the national, international and supranational scale; which implies forging parties and alliances that can redirect public policies towards a short-term response to urgent problems. Also in that sense, gradually go towards a reorganization of the current economic system at different scales; that will require action towards encouraging recycling, increasing R+D investment, promoting things such as universal basic income and services, and seeking ways to reduce national and global socioeconomic inequality through tax mechanisms, among other possible options.</p>

                    <p>The path is long, and many adversities and blockers will be faced; but from the short, medium, and long term it is necessary to foster and coordinate action around a proper change that manages to address current important issues and overcome emerging challenges in order to forge a prosperous future for all.</p>
