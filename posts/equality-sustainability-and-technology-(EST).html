                    <p>Our present is manifesting in a time of unprecedented crisis, where the strains of thought belonging to the past have become obsolete, since they are incapable both to face many old persistent problems, as well as the new emerging issues that will arise in the near future, which as a whole puts us with an unprecedented situation.</p>

                    <p>Fortunately, the possibility of moving forward also becomes open, through drawing new trains of thought, which may be capable of responding to the problems, challenges and opportunities that we have as a species in this time.  These new ideas will imply new theoretical and practical assumptions, which together can open the way to a prosperous future and avoid the direct cataclysm that we are currently heading towards.</p>

                    <p>Like any change process that aims to solve new emergent relevant issues, it must be open, flexible and plural, thus giving the possibility of the appearance of different strains and multiple perspectives, but which nevertheless have to be based in certain frameworks considered necessary and essential.</p>
                    
                    <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/img-post/poblacion.png" alt="">

                    <p>These necessary frameworks must be directly contrasted with the archaic and problematic forms of thought which have put us in this situation in the firstplace; here, consequently, we will emphasize four different axes of ideas that are considered as essential; these are equality, sustainability and technology, and added to these we will also emphasize the need of post-humanist thinking that encompasses the previous ones.</p>

                    <b>Equality</b>

                    <p>Both the conservative visions oriented to the divine order, as well as certain visions associated with social Darwinism -whether biocentric ones or those associated with market fundamentalism- place special emphasis on inequality, even in large quantities, as something natural, inevitable or even desirable. Together, these visions have contributed to the current time when there are massive inequalities between people, groups and regions, which together has led to a concentration of resources and power on a small dominant minority, as well as the misery of millions of people and living beings on this planet. These things -among other factors- will eventually lead us towards societal disintegration, a situation of unleashed violence and even possible social collapse in many vulnerable regions.</p>

                    <p>Besides that, in the near future, this enormous inequality may manifest itself not only socially, but even biologically, where certain minority powerful groups will have access to new biotechnologies that may lead even to more inequality -economic and cognitive-, which would manifest even greater influence and even control over the majority.</p>

                    <p>Now it is time to  re-balance this situation, and for that, it is necessary to understand and spread equitable thinking, the principle of which is to give each one sufficient resources and capacities so that they can fully develop as a person, as part of a society of equals. This implies having the possibility to access resources and services considered basic, to participate in activities and institutions oriented towards training and socialization, and above all to become empowered to make decisions together with others in a symmetrical way. All this is in reach of our civilization thanks to science and technology which has achieved enormous levels of abundance capable of fulfilling such tasks. The problem lies in a very unequal distribution of these resources and capacities as a result of these ideologies based on the inequality mentioned above.</p>
                    
                    <b>Sustainability</b>

                    <p>Most of the thoughts and ideas that have been manifested in contemporary society do not pay attention or even give existence to sustainable thinking, either because they consider “the human” as something external to the environment, this being something purely instrumental -such as the ideologies associated with market fundamentalism or the ones that are based in divine order-; or also even certain ideas associated with postmodernism that are based on a relativistic subjectivity where the environment does not even exist.</p>

                    <p>As a result of all these ideologies, and the assumptions that derive from them, we are suffering a whole series of negative consequences and processes coming from environmental pollution, the overuse of resources and the destruction of our planet in general, which are manifested in phenomena such as climate change, the mass extinction of species, urban pollution, the appearance of pandemic diseases and many other manifestations that not only threaten our well-being but also present themselves as possible existential risks.</p>
                    
                    <p>All of this translates into either a lack of sufficient reaction to these problems -as we can see in different levels of government-, or simply in denying the problem and doing nothing, as certain leaders and leaders are showing.</p>

                    <p>Given this, we need to promote sustainable thinking, and stop once and for all these previous archaic ideas that have little or even nothing at all to do with addressing and solving the root causes of environmental problems that we currently face. At the same time, it is not only necessary for us to change our mental frameworks in relation to the issues, but also to create new organizational systems that are resilient and adaptable to new information and changing events, something that the current system is incapable of to do because of certain structures and incentives that go beyond even of the prevailing social ways of thinking.</p>

                    <b>Technology</b>

                    <p>To think and address the present, as well as the future, we should embrace technology, as well as understand and interpret it, that is to say, leave behind primitivist or technophobic notions, as well as not fall into techno-utopian visions respectively.</p>

                    <p>Technology is one of the main tools we have to solve problems, and these range from socio-organizational creations related to new ways of organizing ourselves as a society, as well as fundamental material techno-products that we use in daily life such as medicines, energy sources or those associated with informational technology.</p>
                   
                   <p>All this implies an active promotion of technological development, understanding how it is produced, how it is related to other sectors of society, and also exploring and interpreting the dangers behind it. All of this implies not rejecting technology, as certain primitivist, postmodern or religious fundamentalist movements do, but also in understanding its risks and limitations, which certain techno-utopian movements do not include.</p>
                   
                   <b>+ Post-anthropocentrism</b>

                    <p>Such forms of equitable, sustainable and technological thoughts should also be understood within a more abstract posthumanist framework, to make them properly functional for the future. In this way post-humanism is a form of aggregate thought related to post-anthropocentrism, which refers to an open framework that goes beyond humanist and anthropocentric assumptions; such as the premises of man-environment dualism, speciesism, individualism, subjectivism, and many other things that make anthropocentrism something already obsolete.</p>

                    <p>Thus, this new Equality, Sustainability and Technology (EST) framework should be approached within a post-humanist framework conceived from the ideals of systemism, non-speciesism, transhumanism, environmentalism; that together manage to encompass, add and combine these basic premises, and consolidate a new train of thought to address the future.</p>
